## What does it mean for a design to be 'responsive'?
Your site/app _responds_ to the screen size it's being browsed on.

More generally, it's about _responding to user need_, not just screen size, but it is the most common consideration.

### What's this 'viewport' that people keep mentioning?

Your user's _viewport_ is their view of your site, which may be smaller than all of the content you're trying to show.

## Why should I care about responsive design?

If you have to do things to adjust your site for a subsection of your users, you're spending time (and money!) not providing value to _the rest_ of your users.

The most efficient way to build things is to make them usable by _everyone_. This won't always be practical, but it's a good starting point.

It's also the best way to build things for the long-term. How people browse the web will continue to evolve in ways we haven't predicted.

## Why should I design 'mobile-first'?

This is often justified by the fact that the majority of users for many sites are on mobile devices. Actually, it's worth considering for any design, because _doing the hardest thing first tends to lead to better results_.

**Restrictions breed creativity**. You'll often find simpler and more efficient ways to present your content if you start without the leeway of a large viewport.

## What are some techniques I can use to achieve a responsive design?

- Design for smaller viewports first. (this is sometimes called 'mobile-first')
- media queries
