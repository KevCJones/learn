# Resources on Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup emphasising the _meaning_ of the information that it contains.

This is in contrast to markup that focuses on _presentation_ or _visual structure_.

For example, a `<li>` (list) element shouldn't be used because you want bullet points - it should be used because you have items that _make sense_ in a list.

For a second example, notice the introduction of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, preferred over `<b>` and `<i>`, because they describe the intent - "I want to emphasis this content" rather than "I want this content to look a certain way".

Semantic HTML has positive effects on accessibility, too - not everyone will consume your content the same way, so describing things more clearly will help.
