# Testing in React Web Applications

React web applications will require slightly different test strategies to testing APIs.
Although the testing of the vanilla Javascript classes (e.g. Usecase/Gateways) will be
similar to how you'd test them in backend systems, testing React components themselves
requires strategies you'd apply to more typical frontend testing.

2. [Unit testing react components](./components.md)
