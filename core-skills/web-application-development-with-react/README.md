# Web Application Development with React

## Summary

1. Can describe situations where you should/shouldn't decide to use React for a project
2. Can setup a React project from scratch in a repeatable way
3. Can describe the different parts of the Javascript ecosystem (e.g. NPM, Webpack, etc)
4. Can demonstrate using TDD on business logic within a React code base
5. Can demonstrate strategies to achieve clear separation of business logic and display logic
with React components
6. Can demonstrate applying sensible styling to React components
7. Can demonstrate strategies and tools to run tests against an API within a React application

## Mark Scheme

### Hedgehog

Learning the fundamentals - How not to hurt yourself with React

- [ ] Can demonstrate an understanding of the benefits of using React
- [ ] Creates an application with the following:
  - [ ] The application can be run on any machine (e.g. Using Docker)
  - Setup/Tooling
    - The candidate has setup the project with the following tools:
      - [ ] A sandbox environment to quickly prototype components within (e.g. Storybook)
      - [ ] Hot-reloading
      - [ ] Tests (The ability to write them, writing one is not a requirement at this stage)
  - Components
    - The candidate is able to explain what the following are:
      - [ ] A component
      - [ ] The use of props within components
      - [ ] The use of state within components
      - [ ] The use of children within components
      - [ ] Responding to user events
- Demonstrating understanding of React fundamentals
  - The candidate can explain the following:
      - [ ] How to style components
      - [ ] The lifecycle of components
      - [ ] Managing application state

### Fox
- Components
  - The candidate has created components demonstrating the following:
    - [ ] A component without any props or state
    - [ ] The use of props
    - [ ] The use of state
    - [ ] The use of children
    - [ ] Responding to user events
    - [ ] Styling components  
- Architecture
  - The candidate can explain the following;
    - [ ] Communicating with APIs
    - [ ] Division of business logic, domain, rendering and state
    - [ ] How to test component rendering
    - [ ] How to test business logic

**Coming Soon - Fox is intended to test ability to write simple components and understanding
of architecture & testing strategies for complex applications**


### Owl

**Coming Soon - Owl is intended to demonstrate ability to put understanding of advanced architecture
principles and testing strategy into practice**
