# Setup

NB: Whilst there is always many alternatives to the following tools, they are the ones we use most often and have the most experience with, and will be using in our examples. 

## Testing tools

If you have created your application with [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/)
you may already have some of the following tools installed. 

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/)
  - This our main testing framework
  - Provides useful features such as `watch` mode, spies, describe/it blocks, and more.
- [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock)
  - Allows you to mock and test HTTP requests in Javascript
  - Similar to [webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) in Ruby
- [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
  - This is used for rendering our components and simulating user interaction with them.
