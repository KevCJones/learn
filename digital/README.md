          <h2>Delivering digital services</h2>
          <p class="lead">More organisations are using digital services to meet user needs. Whether a mobile banking app or applying for a passport online, organisations are providing their users the tools to solve their own needs. This is our methodology for delivering digital services which we hope is useful to you and your team.

          <h5 class="card-title">Delivery</h5>
            <p>
              Delivery as a discipline is to deliver outcomes while considering the wellbeing and organisation of the team.
            </p>
            <p>
              To ensure the needs of users are met, continuous delivery is used. Continuous delivery is a practice which we use to provide value as quickly and efficiently as possible.

          <h5 class="card-title">Product</h5>
            <p>
              Product is used to identify and prioritise needs as well as opportunities. In addition, product also aligns teams around outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is crucial that teams are aware of context and vision of the product in order to meet user needs. This will empower teams to maximise outcomes and impact.

          <h5 class="card-title">Design</h5>
           <p>
              Design is framing the problem in order to understand user needs and existing/new digital services. User research is conducted to validate digital services to meet user needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Digital services must be designed with users in mind alongside iterative user research. We consistently test our designs using prototypes.
