# Mumbling Kata

The goal of this kata is to implement the `accum()` method which takes a string as input and returns a formatted output string.

The following examples illustrate the `accum()` method:

```ruby
accum("a") = "A"
accum("abC") = "A-Bb-Ccc"
accum("aBCd") = "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("QWERTY") = "Q-Ww-Eee-Rrrr-Ttttt-Yyyyyy"
```

## Rules

Note that your `accum()` implementation should also handle an empty string input appropriately.
