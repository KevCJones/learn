#Made Tech Mentorship Guide

##Overview
At Made Tech, mentorship enables Made Tech staff with the opportunity to provide guidance and support to people in the wider tech community. Mentees are able to gain new knowledge and support and develop and enhance their skills.

###General Guidance
* Be kind, have empathy and be supportive
* Don’t share personal information about your mentee in open forums
* Please give at least 48 hours notice before moving or cancelling your session, so that both parties have a chance to adjust their schedules
* When first meeting, take some time to outline what goals you’d like to achieve, and how long it might take to achieve them. We recommend setting somewhere between 6 and 12 sessions and reviewing at the end to see where to go from there. 

###First session guidance
If you have a particular approach or mentorship / pairing style that you’d like to, please feel free to use it. Here are some suggestions to get the ball rolling on the first session:
1. Introduce yourselves
2. Outline goals and objectives
3. Discuss what you both would like out of the sessions - Set some SMART Goals
4. Discuss preferred pairing styles - It’s likely that you will be pairing during the sessions. We recommend using Visual Studio Code Live Share. 

###Any questions?
Feel free to ask any questions in the #supply-academy-mentors or #cop-mentoring channels, or send a message to Charlene Hunter.

Mentors
Thank you for signing up to be a Made Tech mentor. Here’s a little guide for how to prepare and go about the sessions.

The point of doing this is to provide an opportunity for people to expand on their coding skills from professionals in the industry, but also to provide those looking to enter the industry with an insight into what it can be like. 

As a mentor, you will be supporting people at various stages on their tech journeys, these could be people who applied to the Academy, or people who are members or various tech communities or networks. You get to help someone by sharing both your technical and non-technical knowledge and experience, helping them grow on their fundamentals or understand some tricky concepts.
Mentor / Mentee Pairing
There are two ways that we will be pairing mentors with mentees:
Academy Support
Some people who have applied to the Academy will be allocated mentors. These will either be people who will be joining the next run of the Made Tech Academy, or who need more support for a future application. 
Availability and Skill Match
We may have people who get in contact either directly, or through external tech communities looking for support from a mentor with a particular skill. We will pair based on the skills they would like to develop. 

When you are paired, we will give you the following information about the mentee in order to make contact.
Name
Email Address

Please contact your mentee via email, you and your mentee should arrange the time for your sessions. 

We leave it up to you to arrange the sessions with your mentees. 
How will it work?
Once you’re matched up, you will be put in touch with your mentee via email and on slack. If you don’t receive a message within a couple of days of the pairing being allocated, please let me know.

It could be useful to set up a Calendly account, and the mentee can use this to put time in your calendar. 

Once the first session is arranged, you’re good to go!
Before Your Sessions
The main thing to prepare is what you and the mentee will be pairing on the day, but this will be something you and the mentee can discuss over email.

In terms of what you could pair on, a good option would be to use some of the following:

Your Sessions
How you conduct the sessions is up to you! As mentorship is currently done remotely, all you’ll need to do is join the hangouts/zoom link created in your calendar by calendly. 

The first session will likely be filled with introductions and discussions of expectations, but no doubt that you will both want to get coding pretty quickly. Feel free to find a plan that works for both you and your mentee.
Mentoring Successfully
Outline expectations and ground rules from the outset
Ask the mentee their learning priorities, check that they’re on track
Mutually set goals with your mentee
Be clear about your contact schedule
Hold each other accountable

## Mentees
How will it work?

Once you're matched up, we'll email you further information in how to connect with your mentor and their availability for remote pairing. 
What to do once you're paired?
It will be your responsibility to contact your mentor.

If you find that you don't gel with your mentor please email charlene.hunter@madetech.com if you would like to be paired with another mentor.
Before the session
Learning Style
Everybody learns differently, if you have an awareness of your learning style it might be worth sharing this information with your mentor as it may help them when pairing with you or suggesting resources to try in your own time. 

For example, if your learning style is visual you may prefer seeing diagrams when the mentor is explaining new concepts for the first time.

Set Your Expectations
It might be beneficial to have a list or a mind map on the technical skills you would like to develop. You could try pair programming on coding katas (coding exercises) with your mentor instead. Codewars is a good place to sign up and start together.

What will happen on the day?
That is mainly up to you! As we’re conducting this program remotely, all you’ll need to do is join the hangouts link created in your calendar. 

The first session will likely be filled with introductions and discussions of expectations by using SMART goals, but I would imagine that you will both want to get coding pretty quickly.
